# share-place-app

Web application which allows you to share interesting places with your friends. It was created using modern vanilla JavaScript (modules, es6, geolocation api, clipboard api), CSS3 and HTML5. Webpack was used to bundle multiple .js files. I took advantage of Google Maps API to show chosen place on map and get address information.
